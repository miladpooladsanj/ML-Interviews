This repository contains an overview of different topics that can come up in machine learning interviews. Based on personal experience, the majority of available online content only partially cover these topics, which forces an applicant to jump from one resource to another causing a lot of confusion and freustration. For example, one resource provides a built-from-scratch ML algorithm, but does not describe the math behind it. So, the applicant must spend a lot of time figuring out where the code comes from. I will try my best to either describe any non-trivial piece of code that I write, or provide a reference for it.      

The following table lists different components of an ML interview:

| Section  | Interview |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | [Coding (general)](https://github.com/miladpooladsanj/ML-Interviews/tree/main/main/general-coding)  |
| 2 | [ML Coding](https://github.com/miladpooladsanj/ML-Interviews/tree/main/main/ml-coding)  |
