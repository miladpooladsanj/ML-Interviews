I have gathered a number of coding problems + my solutions from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) here. These problems are selected moslty on the basis of the generality of their solutions, i.e., the solution is applicable to many other problems. In a few cases, the problems are selected because their solution contains a creative idea.
